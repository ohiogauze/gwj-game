**FADE IN:**

THE LOUNGEROOM VIEW

The dank little loungeroom smells of settled dust, mildew, and stale crisps.

A woman fades into our view on the radar. The T.V. flickers on, static on loop.

GHOST WOMAN
Alone.

GHOST WOMAN
Wedding -him. 

GHOST WOMAN
Don't! Oh... memories.

GHOST WOMAN
You awful little thing?!

PLAYER
What did they do to her?
