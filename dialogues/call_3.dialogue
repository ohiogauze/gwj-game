Boss: Hey! What happened?
Boss: I haven't been able to get through to you all afternoon.
Yeah... my service dropped out.
Boss: So, did you end up finding out anything weird?
Nope. Just an old lady's memories and the cats that guard them.
Boss: Huh. That's boring.
I guess it is.
In the end, she loved them the same way they loved her...
To death.
